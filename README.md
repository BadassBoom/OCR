# OCR Web Application
This web application provides Optical Character Recognition (OCR) functionality, allowing users to extract text from images and convert it into editable and searchable text.

# Overview
The OCR Web Application is designed to make text extraction from images easy and efficient. Whether you have scanned documents, images with embedded text, or any other type of image containing textual content, this application can help you extract and utilize that information. When a user uploads an image, the application performs image processing tasks to prepare it for OCR. This includes operations such as resizing, noise reduction, and enhancing the image quality to improve the accuracy of text extraction. The OpenCV library is used for these image processing tasks.The core functionality of the OCR Web Application lies in the OCR algorithms. The application uses the Tesseract OCR engine, which is a popular and powerful open-source tool for text recognition. Tesseract analyzes the processed image and extracts the text, employing machine learning techniques and language models to enhance accuracy.

# Features
Image Upload: Users can upload images directly from their devices or provide the URL of an image to be processed.
Text Extraction: The application uses advanced OCR algorithms to analyze the uploaded image and extract the text accurately.
Editing and Download: Extracted text can be edited and downloaded in various formats, including plain text, PDF, and more.
Searchable Text: The converted text is searchable, allowing users to quickly find specific information within the extracted content.
User-Friendly Interface: The web application offers a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to navigate and utilize its features.
# How to Use
1. Access the OCR Web Application by visiting https://badassboom.github.io/OCR/ in your web browser.
2. Choose an image by either uploading it from your device or providing the URL of an image hosted online.
3. Click the "Extract Text" button to initiate the OCR process.
4. Wait for the application to process the image and extract the text.
5. Once the text extraction is complete, you can edit the extracted text if desired.
6. Download the extracted text in your preferred format (plain text, PDF, etc.).
7. Utilize the extracted and converted text for your specific needs, such as editing, searching, or further analysis.
